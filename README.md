# vm-riskxvii
This repository contains source code for a simple CPU that can execute instructions defined by a reduced version of the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The VM is written in C and a python file is provided to generate machine instruction (```.mi````) files that the VM can run. There is also a Makefile provided to build, test and run the VM.
