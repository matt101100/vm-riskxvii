"""
Description of program:
    instruction_array holds 4 byte ints in each index, for a total of 512 indices,
    making a 512 * 4 = 2048 byte size binary. We can manually edit any index of
    this array we want with any given 32-bit risc-v instruction, essentially meaning
    we can use this array to simulate a vm_riskxvii memory image.

    The lines below the array simply write each 32-bit int in instruction memory
    into an out.mi file as binary, creating the readable mi binary that vm_riskvii.c
    can take as input and run. Just make sure to rename out.mi accordingly to what
    the memory image should be doing.

    How to use:

        1. You can generate the hexadecimal or binary numbers representing risc-v instructions
        using https://luplab.gitlab.io/rvcodecjs/

        2. Paste the generate number (hex preferable for brevity) into the instruction_array
        index you want

        3. Run the python program

        4. Use "xxd -e -c 4 out.mi | head -n 512" in terminal to check that the
        write was successful

        5. Rename out.mi to an appropriate title, place into tests and pass the
        file as a memory image to riskvii.o
